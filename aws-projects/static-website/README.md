# AWS Static Website Hosting with S3 (domain name), CloudFront & Route 53

This project demonstrates how to host a static website on AWS using:
- S3 for storage
- CloudFront for content delivery and HTTPS
- Route 53 for domain management
- AWS Certificate Manager for SSL (As we are planning to add HTTPS using CF)


Setup Guide
1. Create an S3 bucket and enable static website hosting.
2. Upload website files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, etc.).
3. Set up CloudFront for caching and HTTPS.
4. Register a domain in Route 53 and point it to CloudFront.
5. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for SSL.
